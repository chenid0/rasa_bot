  utter_subset_clear:
  - text: Filter subset is clear.

      This site contains a list of available molecules that can be purchased. To find molecules that are interest to you type: create subset and then add filters to subset the molecules. Finally, if desired, you can perform diversity analysis to create a diverse library. 
      To learn more type: 
      	help filter target 
      	help filter virus
      	help filter property 
      	help  diversity analysis

      This site offers a list of purchasable molecules. Use "create subset" and add filters to narrow your search. Optionally, perform diversity analysis to generate a diverse library.  
      Try: 
      	help filter target 
      	help filter virus
      	help filter property 
      	help  diversity analysis

      This site offers a list of purchasable molecules. Use "create subset" to select molecules of interest and add filters. You can also perform diversity analysis to create a varied library.  
      Try: 
      	help filter target 
      	help filter virus
      	help filter property 
      	help  diversity analysis
  utter_help_filter_by_target:
  - text: 'To select specific viral targets to add to the filter, type: filter by target. Once viral targets have been selected, this subset can be used to search for similar molecules that are commercially available.'
  utter_help_filter_by_virus:
  - text: 'To select specific viruses to add to the filter, type: filter by virus. Once viruses and/or viral families have been selected, this subset can be used to search for similar molecules that are commercially available.'
  utter_help_filter_by_property:
  - text: 'You can filter molecules by chemical properties, spcifically: logP, TPSA, SASA, HBA, HBD and fractionCSP3. Type: filter by properties to open a UI to set ranges.'
  utter_who_r_u:
  - text: I am ChemBot, a chemistry assistant. I understand simple commands such as 'help'.
  utter_who_creator:
  - text: I was created by smart guys at **Altoris, inc**. See ***www.Altoris.com*** and ***www.ChemApps.com***.
  utter_what_language:
  - text: I am currently only trained to speak English.
  utter_tell_tech_details:
  - text: As an ai-bot, I can help create a molecule library. I contain over 5mil molecules that can be searched, filtered, and analyzed for diversity.
  utter_default:
  - text: Sorry, I donâ€™t understand.
