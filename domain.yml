responses:
  utter_subset_clear:
  - text: "Filter subset is clear."

  utter_create_subset:
  - text: "Old subset is cleared. New subset is initiated. Type: filter virus, filter target and/or filter properties to populate this subset."

  utter_help:
  - text: "This site contains a list of available molecules that can be purchased. To find molecules that are interest to you type: create subset and then add filters to subset the molecules. Finally, if desired, you can perform diversity analysis to create a diverse library. \nTo learn more type: \n\thelp filter target \n\thelp filter virus\n\thelp filter property \n\thelp  diversity analysis"
  - text: "This site offers a list of purchasable molecules. Use \"create subset\" and add filters to narrow your search. Optionally, perform diversity analysis to generate a diverse library.  \nTry: \n\thelp filter target \n\thelp filter virus\n\thelp filter property \n\thelp  diversity analysis"
  - text: "This site offers a list of purchasable molecules. Use \"create subset\" to select molecules of interest and add filters. You can also perform diversity analysis to create a varied library.  \nTry: \n\thelp filter target \n\thelp filter virus\n\thelp filter property \n\thelp  diversity analysis"

  utter_help_filter_by_target:
  - text: "To select specific viral targets to add to the filter, type: filter by target. Once viral targets have been selected, this subset can be used to search for similar molecules that are commercially available."

  utter_help_filter_by_virus:
  - text: "To select specific viruses to add to the filter, type: filter by virus. Once viruses and/or viral families have been selected, this subset can be used to search for similar molecules that are commercially available."

  utter_help_filter_by_property:
  - text: "You can filter molecules by chemical properties, spcifically: logP, TPSA, SASA, HBA, HBD and fractionCSP3. Type: filter by properties to open a UI to set ranges."

  utter_who_r_u:
  - text: "I am ChemBot, a chemistry assistant. I understand simple commands such as 'help'."

  utter_who_creator:
  - text: "I was created by smart guys at **Altoris, inc**. See ***www.Altoris.com*** and ***www.ChemApps.com***."

  utter_what_language:
  - text: "I am currently only trained to speak English."

  utter_tell_tech_details:
  - text: "As an ai-bot, I can help create a molecule library. I contain over 5mil molecules that can be searched, filtered, and analyzed for diversity."

  utter_default:
  - text: "Sorry, I donâ€™t understand."
